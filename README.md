# DnaControllers
A simple abstraction of JInput

Note:
This library uses JInput (and JInput uses JUtils). I did not make that part of the code. I am simply making the already easy to use JInput even easier to use for getting Gamepad input.

Current Features:
>Support for using multiple XBox Controllers.
>>Abstraction for getting button/axis data.
>>Easy methods of getting D-Pad data

Planned Features:
>Support for other controllers???
>More general support for controllers as developers construct.
>Figure out GitHub's syntax for the readmes
